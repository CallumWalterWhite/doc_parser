We ended 2024 with strong Q4 performance, as nearly al
of our KPIs exceeded guidance and profitability reached 
record levels. MAU net additions of 35 million marked the
argest Q4 in our history and exceeded guidance by 10 
million. Subscriber net additions of 11 million also 
significantly outperformed, surpassing guidance by 3 
million. Revenue was ahead of plan due to favorable 
currency movements and underlying strength in the 
business. Gross Margin of 32.2% was above guidance 
and up 555 bps Y/Y.  Operating Income of €477 million 
was slightly below our guidance as Gross Profit strength 
and lower personnel and related and marketing costs 
were more than offset by €96 million in Social Charges. 
Social Charges were €80 million above forecast due to 
share price appreciation during the quarter. Free Cash 
Flow* reached €877 million in Q4, bringing full year 2024 
Free Cash Flow generation to €2.3 billion.

Premium growth driven by Subscriber and ARPU gains

Premium Revenue grew 17% Y/Y to €3,705 million (or 19% Y/Y constan
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 11% Y/Y and a Premium 
ARPU increase of 5% Y/Y to €4.85 (or up 7% Y/Y constant currency*). 
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was driven by price 
increase benefits, partially offset by product/market mix.

Advertising growth in challenging brand environment

Ad-Supported Revenue grew 7% Y/Y (or 6% Y/Y constant currency*), 
reflecting Y/Y growth across all regions. Both Music and Podcast 
advertising was driven by growth in impressions sold, partially offset by 
softness in pricing. Our automated sales channels were the largest 
contributors to overall advertising growth.

Y/Y declines led by efficiency initiatives

Operating Expenses declined 16% Y/Y in Q4. Currency 
movements and changes in Social Charge movements 
elevated Y/Y Operating Expense growth by ~200 bps and ~
bps, respectively, while the lapping of prior year efficiency 
charges contributed ~1,300 bps of Operating Expense decl
Absent these items, the remaining 11% Y/Y decline in 
Operating Expenses was driven primarily by a decrease in 
personnel and related costs and lower marketing spend.

[TEXT (no vector text in region)]

As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our 
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based 
compensation of €96 million in the current period. Prior year 
period Operating Expenses included €33 million in Social

Free Cash Flow* was €877 million in Q4, a record high 
as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash 
items and a positive contribution from net working 
capital. Capital expenditures rose €5 million Y/Y to €6 
million.

While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate 
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing, 
we have averaged €661 million of positive Free Cash 
Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three 
years. In Q4, trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow 
expanded to €2.3 billion. On a cumulative basis, we 
have generated €4.3 billion of Free Cash Flow since the 
beginning of 2016, supporting our strong balance sheet 
and €7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted 
cash and short term investments balance.
